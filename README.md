# image-processing
GUI program of the basic algorithm of digital image processing, realizing the basic processing of image reading and writing, scaling, rotating and tilting, as well as the low-pass filtering and rectangular filtering methods in image enhancement and smoothing; The gradient method is used to realize edge detection. The Sobel, Roberts and Prewitt operators are compared, and the Gaussian Laplace operator is also tried. At the same time, I understood the YUV format and image negative conversion while completing the experimental requirements. Finally, matlab is used to export the matlab built-in app and the executable files that can be installed and run independently.
